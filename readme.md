### How to Search or Ask

The very first thing you need to learn in undergraduate programming/computer related courses is not how to do something, but how to teach yourself to do something.

These following tutorials and articles will teach you the efficient ways to search/ask something, both online and offline:

### More Basic Things You May Need To Know

We only have limited time and energy for the labs, so it’s quite impossible to cover all basic things, there is always something missed. Fortunately, there are lectures specifically designed for the missing knowledge. If you feel there is any prerequisite we missed, you can learn them from:

### Using AIGC Tools or GPT for Learning

We encourage you to use AIGC tools or GPT for learning purposes, but keep it in mind, you shouldn’t leave everything to them, please use AI tools wisely.

### Contact Us

If you encountered any problem during your labs or assignments, you could contact us (TAs) and professors for help. But before that, it would be best to make sure that you have comprehensively understood [the way of asking](#how-to-search-or-ask), please at least give them a glance, it would make our communications easier.
